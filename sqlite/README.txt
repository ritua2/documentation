SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
To test the program, run the following commnad:
$ module load sqlite
$ cat test.txt | sqlite3 tt.db

The output looks like following:
main: tt.db r/w

And a empty database file tt.db is created.
